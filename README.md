### Basic information

My name is John Norberg, and I am a 21-year-old student currently living in Sweden. I have dual citizenship (Swedish and Australian) and have lived and studied in both countries, though the process has been very back and forth since I have moved between these two countries 4 times. Although I have dual citizenship neither of my parents are Australian, my dad being Swedish and my Mum being Bulgarian. I have been unable to get a clear answer as to why they decided to move from Sweden to Perth when I was 4, then back to Sweden when I was 8, then to Melbourne when I was 10, however; I am grateful for this since I have gotten to see a lot of different cultures and meet a lot of different, interesting people. It has also allowed me to basically have 2 first languages, English and Swedish. I am trying to learn Bulgarian but the number of online resources for this are borderline non-existent, and my Mum sadly does not possess an ounce of talent for teaching. Hopefully one day however I will learn to speak it fluently. 

Currently the only degree I have is a high school diploma. I have been enrolled in a 5-year robotics program at a university here in Sweden (MDH). However, I decided to switch to a more programming-oriented field of study. This is because the robotics program consisted of roughly equal amounts of programming and electronics, it was there were I discovered I have no interest or talent for electronics, it was also there I discovered my interest in programming, so choosing to enrol in that program was a double-edged sword so to speak. 


### Interest in IT
I have always loved gaming, as I am sure is extremely typical in people who are interested in IT. I got my first Gameboy when I was 4 and refused to put it down, which evolved into me playing flash games when I got to use my parents Dell desktop around 4 years later. Then when I was 11, I fell in love with Minecraft, so much so in fact that I even spent weeks trying to figure out how to make my own server for it, only to fail repeatedly because I could not get the port forwarding to work. But my interest in It and programming really started later than that.

My interest in IT really started, as mentioned earlier, from my prior university studies. The aspect within IT I have the most interest in is the programming aspect. Specifically, I really enjoy both the creativity it allows as well as the problem-solving aspect. These two things are what really sparked and kept my interest in IT as whole, but mainly programming. So, to summarize, games are what sparked an interest with IT technology, such as computers, but my studies at university really opened my eyes to the world of IT and how much I enjoy working with it. Despite how many tantrums I have thrown over code that somehow seem to go against the very laws of physics by not working, I still can’t say any other subject has kept me this interested and happy before!


### Why RMIT

The reason I chose to apply for this RMIT course is because of two main points. The first being that I have a friend who is currently a student at RMIT and recommended it to me. The Second is that since I am currently trying to move back to Australia, I can only apply for single courses since studying a whole program from another country while attempting to move is far too much for me to comfortably handle. So while taking my friends advice and my own circumstances into account, I researched RMIT and the courses offered and found that it ticked all the boxes!

I expect to learn a lot surrounding the different areas of IT, what they imply, what further research into the field will entail, goals within these different areas, working in groups, ethical questions ext. I am also interested to see if my interest in IT as whole will broaden after this course or if I will still be mainly interested in programming after this course is compete. The ethics aspect is also something I am hoping to learn more about as I think it is an interesting subject to discuss as even people not to involved in IT will still be able to grasp a lot of the core concepts. 

### Ideal Job

```markdown
[Ideal Job Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/q-Artificial-Intelligence-Programmer-jobs.html?vjk=3e82daa8cbdb475a)

The description for this job is broad, however, the way I interpreted it is that you will work in a team on developing and researching AI. 
What makes this appealing to me is my interest in AI, the different ways in which to program it, how it works, why some learning methods work better for different tasks than others, the ethics involved as so on. 
This position also seems to allow for one to be at the forefront of AI, which I find very appealing. Also, since the actual description is so vague, I think that the projects allow for some creative freedom for the people involved. 


```
The skills required for this position seem to be a few years of experience in the field as well as at least a master’s in computer science. You would also need knowledge with different frameworks as well as have the skills to be able to work well in groups, lastly since it is asking for someone able to live and work in the U.S one needs to be able to use English to a high degree (probably fluently). 

The skills I have related to this position is that I am fluent in English and have no problem working in groups. Other than that, I have a large interest in programming and have completed a few programming courses in C at a university level. 

To obtain these skills, I will first have to get a master’s in computer science, which is already no easy feat. While studying I will also need to work hard to get and maintain a GPA which both me and potential future employers would be happy with. I would also like to find a place to intern at, over summer breaks, which would be in the IT field. Then I will need to get a job after graduating which is focused on AI and keep this job or find other(s) in the same field, and work with it for a few years. 

### Personality test

The results from the tests were interesting. Being a more introverted logical person is an accurate description of me, although it is hard for me to discern that myself since I can’t be objective. The famous people will similar personalities was also interesting. But in saying that, the Brigs-Myers personality test is quite limiting in that it only divides people into 16 groups. So while some points were accurate, such as me being logical and somewhat introverted, I will not be basing my career and life choices on it. 

The learning style test was also interesting, and the results do match with my experience, I do feel like I learn better visually. The results from the last test were what I expected them too roughly be. 

I think these results show that I am good at working in a team environment. Since the results from the big five personality test show that I have a high amount of agreeability I think that I would be able to be a good team member in most teams. However, the results also show that I am not drawn to any leadership roles. 

I think the most important thing to consider for me when forming a team is that I am not drawn to any leadership roles, so should therefor stay clear of groups where I would need to take on such a role. Another think to consider is that I am a visual learner according the second test, so should I not understand something we are working on within the group I would be able to learn best if somebody showed me how to do said thing with visual aids. 

### Project idea

#### Overview

The project idea I have is to create a web resumé for myself/within a group. The main idea behind this project is to build the website from scratch (only taking inspiration with the design from existing themes), fill it with resume details and programming projects I/the group will have worked on e.g., sorting algorithms. The idea behind this project is for it to be a growing with me, as in I will add/update projects to it as I steadily get better at programming. This project also allows for huge creative freedom and, while it is not a product, will help me sell myself in the future by hopefully being one of the keys for me getting the job I want! 


#### Motivation

The reason I chose this project is because of the creative freedom to create a large array of different smaller projects (which I like because I have a lot of different interests withing programming) and the fact that this project will grow with me. By adding newer and better projects to it as I get better will increase my odds when applying for jobs, allow me to visually see my growth in the field and will be fun to work on. 

#### Description

The website will be programmed from scratch with as little external help as possible. This will show that I have the knowledge to work on both front and back-end projects in terms of web development. The website will also house several different programming projects, both large and small. The idea behind having the website display these projects is both to show of what I can do in terms of programming as well as be a fun way for me to explore different areas of programming, thus also allowing me to see where my weak points lye at any given point in time. 

The ideas I have for projects to display on the website as of now are: a visual representation of different popular sorting  and search algorithms such as bubble sort and binary search trees, different simple games that I have programmed in different languages (such as snake), a chess AI (to start with a very basic one which will hopefully grow to me more competent later), a more complex game made in unity, a game made with my own engine, a theme changer for the website (a way to change to whole design of the website while having the information on it be the same) and making the website responsive to different sized monitors and tablets/phones. 
These are the ideas I have right now for projects to display on the website; however, these are not yet set in stone and the more complex ones will not be on the website for a while since I do not yet have the skills to make them. The main principle will be consistent though since the idea is to dive into different areas of programming and display my capabilities within these different fields. 

While this project isn’t a product so to be speak, it is a device made to sell a product; myself. Since it will function as a resume, I will hopefully be able to use it to secure a job that I want in the future. The project will also allow me to grow a lot as a programmer and discover new areas of programming and ways to use code which I never would have found otherwise. The project will function both to help me sell myself later in my career when I start applying to jobs and be a way for me to explore, learn and grow as a programmer. By experiencing different areas of this field, I will also be able to search for jobs more specific to my interests in programming. It will also be fun to work on, which is one of the key points as to why I chose this to my project.  


#### Tools and technology

The tools I will need for this project is the appropriate hardware, a good pc, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. I will also need software such as visual studios and Unity. But the tool I will need and make use of the most is the internet and the information gathered from it. YouTube videos on how to program certain things, troubleshooting help, GitHub question and answer, online books and so on. With future projects I may also need more hardware such as a raspberry Pi or Arduino. 

#### Skills required

The skills required to start this project are non-existent since all you need is the ability to find the relevant information for your project and start. However, the more projects I add the more skills are required. Since one of the main points of this project is to improve my programming skill set in a fun way, the skills to start are low, but the skills to make this project into a good one will require a lot of programming knowledge. 

#### Outcome

If this project succeeds, I will have a well develop, fleshed out website resume that will be one of the keys for getting me my dream job in the future. I would also have grown a lot as a programmer and a wide area of knowledge in different fields such as web development, game design, algorithms, AI and so on. While I will be a jack of all trades master of none, I will hopefully know which area I wish to work with and, with time, master.
